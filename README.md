# ATM-MiniProject
In this mini project, I have developed an ATM system using C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The system offers the following key functionalities:

Check Balance: This feature allows the user to inquire about their account balance.

Cash Withdrawal: Users can withdraw cash from the ATM, but with the condition that the entered withdrawal amount must be less than or equal to their account balance to be a valid transaction.

User Details: This function permits users to view and verify their account details with the bank.

Update Mobile Number: Users have the ability to update the mobile number linked to their bank account.

By implementing these functionalities using OOP concepts, we've created a robust and user-friendly ATM system that enhances the banking experience for customers.
